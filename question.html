        I know I am massively imperfect, and life with me won't always be what you desire. <p>I make a promise to cherish, respect and love you in the same way each and every day.</p>
        <p>So, my beautiful girl, I have something to ask you. With all the love and sincerity in my heart:</p> <p>Will you be my girlfriend?</p>
